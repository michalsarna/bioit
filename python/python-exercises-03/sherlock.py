Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it
just as it happened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, it
seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone
at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take
it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about
the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission,
and I made for my sister’s house. She had married a man named Oakshott,
and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market.
All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a
detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring
down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what
was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been
upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard
and smoked a pipe, and wondered what it would be best to do.

“I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just
been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell
into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what
they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two
things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where
he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to
turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought
of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might
at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone
in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time,
and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and
suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the
best detective that ever lived.

“My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of
her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as
good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry
my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind
this I drove one of the birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred
tail. I caught it, and, prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down
its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I
felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the
creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what
was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and
fluttered off among the others.
